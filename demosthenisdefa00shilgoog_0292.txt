μεγίστων τε καὶ φίλων τάληθῆ εἰδότα λέγειν ἀσφαλὲς καὶ
θαῤῥαλέον, ἀπιστοῦντα δὲ καὶ ζητοῦντα ἅμα τούς λόγους

am afraid thol we ere sure to find.'’ If Ι wish to express
my seor thas sn archer will miss α mark, I should ordi-
narily convey my meaning by δέδοικα μή ἁμάρτῃς, but if Ι
intended lo insinuate there is no chance of his hilting it,
