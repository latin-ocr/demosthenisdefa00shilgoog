As in preparing for the press my second issue of

Demosthenis de Falso Leontione I had before me
Dindorl's Oxford Edition of our orator, so Ι have in
revising the present had access to Bekker's stereo-
typed Editi0n¹, and to Voemel’s Orationes Demos·
thenis contro Aeschinem de Corona et de Falso Leoc-

tione, and have set down mainly, if not completely, '

the points of differenoe between these Editors and

myself. Bekker follows mora closely than he lor-
merly did, but by no means blindly, the text as

given by the Codex S„ while Voemel scarcely ever
departs from it ¹. With due deference to these Ori-

tios I confess Ι see no cause to modily my originally
pronounced judgment of the Parisian Manuscript.
I have not introduced much additional matter, my
aim rather having been to carelully revise the former
editione. ’ Ι hope that I have so far been successful
as to leave no considerable amount of corrigenda.

’Vosmel (p. 556) reminds sume that I have weighed the
me, with some degree ol smart· MS. in an even balance, andoc-
ness, “ Codices sunt non nume· oasionally found it wanting.
