APPENDIX A.

Vsalous constructione after words of seurinq are ex-
amined hy Hermann on Vigor, n 265, with his usual
minuteness and refinement, though he has left some un-
noticed. The meod ordinarily used, inasmuch asto seor
properly implies a sature idea, is the subjunctive. But,
as in our own idiom “I sear you have mistaken the
meaning‚'' intends to convey no doubt or uncertainty as
to the fact having occurred, but is merely expressive of
courtesy on the part of the speaker, so in Greek also
instances of an indicative are not unusual. We find
therefore many constructione: (1) δέδοικα μὴ ποιῇς. (2)
ὃ. μὴ ποιήσῃς. (3) δ. μὴ ποιεῖς. (4) δ. μὴ ε’ποίεις. (5) δ.
μὴ ἐποίησας· (6) ὃ. μή πεποίηκας, and even in relation to
a future action, (7) δέδοικα μὴ ποιήσεις. l and 200118-

for 3, 4, 5, and 6, the Latina have no distinctive mode of
expression, since from other causes their subjunctive must
necessarily be used: 7 may be translated cerem ue factu
rua ais. It is not very easy to explain the distinction in
our own language: 1. “I sear that you are on the point
of doing it‚” which is used to express an uncertainty
whether the event is on the point of being done, buta
probability that it is. 2. “I am afraid that you will dc

it.” 3. “I am afraid that you are doing it:'’ to use a .

writing, and I look over his shoulder end see him mis-
