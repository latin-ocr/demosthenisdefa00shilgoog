became possessor 01 0 copy 01 this contribution to
the “Catena Classicoruml’ My examination 01 the
first sheet seemed to support the rumonr which
had reached me; and Ι confess that I thought it
a work 01 supererogation to add to my other occu·

pations ,the necessity 01 reading throughout 0 new
English edition of 0 Speech on which Ι had spent
