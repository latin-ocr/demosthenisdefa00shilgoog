compare Eur. Ion 1523 ὅρα σύ, μῆτερ, μή σφαλεῖσ’ di παρ-

Hermann's remarks on this passage Iperfcctly agree, that

For Elmsley on Eur. Med 310 strangely conceivss the
use of the indicative after μὴ isto be restricted praeteritis,
and more strangely that the apamiae precem has not a
future signification. See Hermann’s adnotat. on that
passage.) Op. Plat. Phaet 77 D δεδιέναι τδ τῶν παίδων,

oration δέδοικα μὴ τούναντίον οὗ βούλομαι ποιῶ, σφόδρα

so clear. The sense might very well be: “I seer lest]
shall d0,” (cuijunctioe), or “I fear that Ι am doing‚'’ (iu-
dicatioc). If the former, compare de Ooron. p. 269 ἓ 125
ὅρα μὴ τούτων μὲν ε’χθρός ᾖς, ε’μὸς δὲ προσποιῇ· “Lest you
bc found to be.'’ See Herm. on Med. 310 p. 356 Ed. Lipa.
I rather am inclined to understand it as an indicative.
Respecting the use of the perfect indicative all critics
agree. In Ι 3· of this speech ἐμπεποιήκῃ, the reading of
some MSS. and most editions, is faulty. For Ι quite
incline to Elmsley's opinion (Mus. Orit 1. p. 356): “We
strongly suspect that if Demosthenes had employed the
subjunctive in this passage, he would have said ἐμπεποιη-
xis ᾖ. The Orators generally, if not always, express this
subjunctive and its corresponding optative¹ by the auxi·

. lioryvcrb and the participle. Thus we find in the same ·
