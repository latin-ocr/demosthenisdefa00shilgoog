’ APPENDIX 0. 285

have arisen from the uae of the negative, like our ‘nay,’
immo, or arcii (ante) in Italianl which are negative in-
asmuch as they object to the preceding phrase as not
being strong enough, whilst they agree with its general
meaning, and enhance its forcel Certainly in these cases
the negative and affirmative sensas often approach very
near to one another, aa, for instance, in the following
passage of Β. J onson: ‘A good man often profits by his
endeavour, pcc, when absent3 acy, when dead, by his
example and memory! ’¹

There appears to me to be great truth in this remark. ’
However‚ I have at present nothing to do with the ¹
investigation of the Latin aa, or the English aoy, but
will endeavour, from the Greek authors, to ascertain the
meaning of ναί. Ihave observed in the Orators the
following passages Dem. de Ooron. p. 310 §251 ναί,
φησίν· ἀλλὰ τδ voi Κεφάλου καλόν, vi μηδεμίαν γραφήν
φυγεῖν. hnstocr. Ρ. 652 ἓ 96 ναί· πῶς ε’γῶ διδάξω.
[Dem] Aristog. p. 791 ἕ 72 ναί, φησίν· ἀδίκως γάρ μ’

ἐγγέγραφεν. Pantaanct. 977 ἓ 36 ναί, φησίν· ἀλλὰ κᾶν
ἄλλο τι α’δικῇ τις περὶ τὰ μέταλλα, κἀὶ τούτων εἰσὶ δίκαι
Aeschin. de Geron. §28 p. 57 Sa: 423 R. ναί· ἀλλ’ ἀντι-

διαπλέκει πρδς τοῦτο εὐθὺς ὥς οὔτ’ ἔλαχε τειχοποιδς οὔτ’

ἐχειροτονήθη diri τοῦ δήμου. ἓ 48 p. 60 = 437 ναί· εἴ γε’ σε’
τις ἄλλη πόλις στεφανοῖ· εἰ did δῆμος o‘ Ἀθηναίων. §84
p. 65 = 478 ναί· ἀλλὰ χαλκοῖς καὶ ἀδαμαντίνοις τείχεσιν, eis
αὐτός φησι, τῆν χώραν ἡμῶν ἐτείχισε. Dinarch. c. Demosth.
§lp 91 St. :6 R. ναί· κατέψευσται γὰρ ἦ βουλή Δημο-
σθένους. In all these passages I conceive it will be granted
that ναί has at least a quaaiaegaticc meaning, answcring
to our “ nay;” and in fact doce aot ao maccla acrae the pur-
poac os affirminp tlte preceding position, aa of artearte
ia tlte mbacqaeat objectioa.

1 now come to the use of tha word in other writers.
It occurs in Homer’s Iliad seven times: 1. 234 ναὶ μοὶ
