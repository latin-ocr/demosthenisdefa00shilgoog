mood¹. The latter pa1t⁹ of the 1110(μῆ following ὥστε
with the infinitiva) appears occasionally to be violated. I
will first however, in passing, speak of the difference be
tween the two modes of expression.

Matthiae, Gr. Gr. ἕ 629 1. 0, remarks: “I have not yet
been able to satisfy myself whether any and what differ-
enee exists between the construction of ὥστε with an infi-
nitive and indicative Hermann, ad Vigor, p. 852 n,
352 b, seems to suppose an anacoluthon when ὥστε is
joined with an indicative.’' Hermann’s words are rather
tembricose, and may possibly not be rightly understood:
and Ι do not remember whether he has elsewhere ex-
plained himself more clearly. The difference seems simply
to be this: οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε οὐκ ἐβούλετο· “he was so
foolish that he did not wish,'' (expressive of the real
result or consequence). οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε μὴ βούλε·
σθαι· “he was so foolish as not to wish,'’ (expressive of the
natural consequence). In Latin the distinction might be
marked by translating the former, at noluerit, the latter,
et nollet. Novit is obvious that an energetic speaker,
wishing to express that the result (was not only of a

nature to follow, but) actually did follow, would employ
the indicative: whereas in ordinary and unimpassioned
language cle infinitioe would imply all that was necessary,
¹ the natural consequence supposing the recl. Accordingly
in the Orators, much more frequently than in other
writers, the construction ὥστε 01 (ὥστε οὐ) with the indi-
cative occurs.
