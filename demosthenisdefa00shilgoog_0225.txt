Aeschines prosecuted and de·

salt oi this? 'l'c wit, he will
meet with no commiseration,
no {allow-feeling at your hands.
Nay more, in his accusation he
chose torevileme. And what
is the result of this? Iwho
know his willencus conduct
better than any one shall meet
with your greater forbearance
in my conducting the present
prosecution than Ι otherwise
should have done, because as
one of his colleagues, the task
Ihave undertaken naturally is
somewhat invidious. Nay more:
he has by his artifices put off
the trial so long, that it has
fallen upon a most critical
